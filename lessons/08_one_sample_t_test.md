### One-sample t-test
Confidence interval and one-sample t-test are two sides of the same coin. Let us calculate 95 % confidence interval for
a sample generated by function `rnorm`:
```R
x<-rnorm(10, mean=20, sd=2)
sem<-sd(x)/sqrt(length(x))
mean(x)+sem*qt(p=c(0.025,0.975), df=(length(x)-1))
```
We can make a two-tailed t-test (at the significance level  of 5 %) with the null hypothesis that the mean of x is equal to 20.
The null hypothesis is rejected if 20 is outside the confidence interval. You can replace `p=c(0.025,0.975)` by
`p=c(0.005, 0.995)` for the significance level 1 % etc.

Another option is to calculate criterion R and compare it with corresponding quantile of t-distribution:
```R
R<-abs(mean(x)-20)*sqrt(length(x))/sd(x)
R
qt(p=0.975, df=(length(x)-1))
```
The null hypothesis is rejected if R is bigger than the quantile of t-distribution.

The most convinient t-test option is to use the function `t.test`:
```R
t.test(x, mu=20)
```
The null hypothesis is rejected if p-value is lower than 0.05 (or 0.01 for the significance level of 1 %).
The function `t.test` also provides the criterion R (called t), degrees of freedom, confidence interval and mean.

One-tailed t-test can be done similarly:
```R
mean(x)+sem*qt(p=c(0,0.95), df=(length(x)-1))
t.test(x, mu=20, alternative="less")
mean(x)+sem*qt(p=c(0.05,1), df=(length(x)-1))
t.test(x, mu=20, alternative="greater")
```
#### Tips and tricks
* you can iterate on the results of the function t.test:
```R
tt<-t.test(x, mu=20)
tt
tt[3]
```
* you can change the significance level for the confidence interval by parameter `conf.level`:
```R
t.test(x, mu=20)
t.test(x, mu=20, conf.level=0.99)
t.test(x, mu=20, conf.level=0.999)
```
