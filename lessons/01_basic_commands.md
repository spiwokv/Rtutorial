### Basic R commands
First function in R will ask you whether you want to save data and then it will close R:
```R
q()
```
This will close R without asking you:
```R
q("n")
q(save="n")
```
To show `plot` as an example of function, type:
```R
a <- 1:100
b <- sin(a)
plot(a, b)
```
This will work:
```R
plot(a, b, main="My plot")
```
The R engine knows that first two parameters of the function `plot` are coordinates `x` and `y`, respectively. However, this will not work:
```R
plot(a, b, "My plot")
```
because R does not know that `"My plot"` links to the parameter `main` (the main title). It is possible to specify all options:
```R
plot(x=a, y=b, main="My plot")
```
Help could be found by:
```R
help(plot)
?plot
apropos("svd")
help.search("svd")
```
Example or demo can be found as well:
```R
example(image)
demo(graphics)
```
Basic operations:
```R
1+1
2-1
3*3
6/3
```
R recognizes integers and floats from the context:
```R
5/2
5.0/2.0
```
Power, modulo, integer division:
```R
3Ë†3
3**3
5%%2
5%/%2
```
R waits until command finished:
```R
1+
1
```
The hash sign `#` is used to add comments (code after `#` is ignored)
```R
1+1#+1
```
Spaces are ignored:
```R
1+1
1 + 1
1+         1
1           +1
```
Basic constants and fuctions:
```R
pi
cos(pi)
sin(pi)
exp(1)
abs(-4)
```
Logarithm is natural by default, decadic and binnary are available as well:
```R
log(exp(2))
log10(1000)
log2(16)
```
Complex numbers are supported as well:
```R
2i
2i*2i
```
One can assign a value to a variable:
```R
x <- 20
x
y <- 10
y
x+y
```
Logical and string variables are available as well:
```R
x<-FALSE
x
y<-"string"
y
```
Equal works as well in most cases, but use `<-` to be on the safe side.
```R
x = 20
y = 10
x+y
```
It is possible to change (e.g. increment) the value of a variable:
```R
x <- 10
x <- x + 1
x
```
R recognizes capitals and small letters:
```R
a<-1
A<-2
a
A
a+A
```
Vectors can be defined by function `c()`:
```R
x <- c(1, 3, 2)
x
```
Vectors with increments of 1 can be easily generated by:
```R
x <- 1:10
x
```
It can be used in the oposit way:
```R
x<-10:1
x
```
It is possible to print individual items from the vector:
```R
x <- c(1,5,2,3,4,7)
x
x[1]
x[2]
x[3:6]
x[c(1,3)]
```
Another way how to make a vector:
```R
seq(from=6, to=21, by=2)
rep((1:4), times=2)
rep((1:4), each=2)
```
It is possible to add, substract, multiply or divide a vector by a number:
```R
x<-1:5
x*2.5
x/2.5
x+2.5
x-2.5
```
It is possible to sum or multiply two vectors element-wise:
```R
x<-c(1,3,2)
y<-4:6
x+y
x*y
```
To get a dot product you need to type:
```R
x%*%y
```
You can apply a function item-wise on a vector:
```R
x<-1:4
exp(x)
```
Matrix can be created by function `matrix` with two possible `byrow` option (`FALSE` is the default):
```R
x<-matrix(1:12, ncol=3)
x
x<-matrix(1:12, ncol=3, byrow=TRUE)
x
```
Matrix can be transposes:
```R
t(x)
```
Matrix can be created by combining and adding columns or rows:
```R
x<-1:4
y<-c(3,2,6,5)
rbind(x, y)
cbind(x, y)
```
Matrix elements can be accessed by indexes in square brackets (`[1,]` is for the first row, `[,1]` for the first column):
```R
x<-1:4
y<-c(3,2,6,5)
xy <- cbind(x, y)
xy
xy[1,]
xy[1,1]
xy[1,2]
xy[,1]
xy[,2]
```
Special object for data analysis in R is `data.frame`:
```R
x<-1:4
y<-c(3,2,6,5)
mydata <- data.frame(x,y)
mydata
mydata[1]
mydata[2]
mydata$x
mydata[1,1]
mydata[2,1]
mydata[2,]
```
Logical operations can such as negation, or and and can be used in operations with `data.frame`, lets show some:
```R
x<-TRUE
!x
y<-FALSE
x|x
x|y
y|y
y&y
x&y
x&x
1<2
1>2
1==1
1==2
```
Loops are not as important R as in classical programing languages, but it is possible to use them:
```R
for(i in 1:3) {
  print(i)
}
```
In R it is possible to define a new function:
```R
sinpluscos <- function(x) {
 y<-sin(x)+cos(x)
 return(y)
}
sin(1)+cos(1)
sinpluscos(1)
```
R contains many pre-defined datasets:
```R
faithful
data()
```
Beside standard R functions and datasets it is possible to install new packages from R repositories:
```R
installed.packages()
install.packages("igraph")
library(igraph)
```
That's all, lets try to read some data in the next lesson and then we will analyse them. 

####Tips and tricks

* you don't remember exactly the command (e.g. you are not sure whether it is `len` or `length`)? Just type the begining of the command and double-click tabulator. You can use it also for parameters of a function.

* if the command is too long you can separate it on two or more lines (R waits untill the command is closed).

* it is better not to use trivial names for variables because you can overwrite some existing variables.

* to generate a vector with constant increment (e.g. 2, 4, 6 ... 10):
```R
x<-2*1:5
```

* you can reverse the order of a vector by:
```R
x<-2*1:5
x[5:1]
```
